•Operating systems are an essential part of any computer systemو
it is the core software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources.
It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer, providing a user-friendly interface
and handling the complex tasks of resource allocation and management.

1-Introduction to OS  

•An Operating System (OS) is a program that manages the computer hardware.
It also provides a basis for Application Programs and acts as an intermediary between computer User and compter Hardware.
Examples of widely used OS include Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, macOS, iOS, and Android.

•The computer system comprises several components: at the base level is hardware including the CPU,  
memory (RAM and ROM), and I/O devices such as keyboards and monitors.  
•The Operating System sits above the hardware, managing resources and providing a platform for system and application software.  
System software operates directly on the hardware, while application software runs on top of the OS.  
•This structure illustrates how the OS interacts with both hardware and software to facilitate computing tasks.

•there are two kinds of software:  

1-system software : used to command or modify computer hardware, operating system is also a kind of system software  

2-application software : used to perform specific task and that can be directly used by users    

•Examples of application software include word processors like Microsoft Office Word, spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel, compilers for code writing, text editors like Notepad, and web browsers like Google Chrome.

•if there is no operatig system you have to manually tell the computer hardware everything that you have do like opening applications,  
typing, displaying text, and saving files, which involves complex coding for this actions   

•so The Operating System simplifies user interaction with computer hardware by handling all this tasks. This allows users to focus on their tasks without needing to manually code every interaction with the hardware. Essentially, the OS acts as an intermediary, making computing easier and more accessible by managing complex hardware interactions.
